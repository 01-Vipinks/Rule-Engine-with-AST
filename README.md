# Rule-Engine-with-AST
The objective of this project is to develop a simple 3-tier rule engine application with a front-end (UI), back-end (Flask API), and database (MongoDB). The rule engine dynamically evaluates user eligibility based on custom rules that involve conditions on user attributes like age, department, salary, and experience.
